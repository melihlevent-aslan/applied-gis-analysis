## Overview
This repository serves as a portfolio for applied tasks in **Geographic Information Systems (GIS)**. It demonstrates proficiency in handling Vector, Raster, and SQL database interactions to solve real-world spatial planning problems.

## Projects

### 1.  Urban Facility Distribution Analysis
**Goal:** Assess the spatial distribution of public facilities.
* **Techniques:** Data Import (CSV/GeoJSON), SQL Attribute Queries, Density Mapping.
* **Tools:** QGIS, PostgreSQL/PostGIS.
* **Outcome:** Heatmaps showing service gaps in urban areas.

### 2.  Site Suitability Analysis for New Parks
**Goal:** Identify optimal locations for a new city park based on multi-criteria constraints.
* **Techniques:** Buffer Zones, Spatial Joins, Geometric Intersection/Difference.
* **Logic:** *Find areas > 500m from existing parks AND < 200m from bus stops AND not in industrial zones.*

### 3.  Terrain & Flood Risk Assessment (3D)
**Goal:** Analyze digital elevation models (DEM) to predict flood-prone regions.
* **Techniques:** Raster Processing, Slope/Aspect Analysis, CRS Reprojection.
* **Visualization:** 3D Terrain draping and water level simulation.

##  Tools & Standards
- **Software:** QGIS 3.x, PostGIS
- **Data Formats:** Shapefile (SHP), GeoPackage (GPKG), GeoTIFF
- **CRS:** EPSG:25832 (ETRS89 / UTM zone 32N)
